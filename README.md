# Data_Science_Project
Developing Machine Learning Models using convolutional Neural Networks for Early and Accurate Detection of Benign and Malignant Skin Cancer

There are 5 files in total
3 of them correspond to the models developed
1 of them is a video presentation by our project team
And last one is the Report file for the Project
